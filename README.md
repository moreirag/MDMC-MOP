"Maximum Dispersion, Maximum Concentration: Enhancing the Quality of MOP Solutions"

## Abstract
Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) often require a trade-off between conflicting objectives, maximizing both diversity and convergence in the objective space. This study presents an approach to improve the quality of MOP solutions by optimizing the dispersion in the decision space and the convergence in a specific region of the objective space. Our approach defines a Region of Interest (ROI) based on a cone representing the decision maker's preferences in the objective space, while enhancing the dispersion of solutions in the decision space using a uniformity measure. The combination of solution concentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space intensifies the search for Pareto-optimal solutions while increasing solution diversity. When combined, these characteristics improve the quality of solutions and avoid the bias caused by clustering solutions in a specific region of the decision space.  Preliminary experiments indicate that this method enhances multi-objective optimization by producing solutions that effectively balance dispersion and concentration, mitigating bias in the decision space.
